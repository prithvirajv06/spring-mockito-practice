Mockito is a popular Java framework used for creating mock objects, which help simulate the behavior of real objects in unit testing. Let's break down some key terminology in Mockito to get you started:

### Key Terms in Mockito:

1. **Mock**:  
   A mock is a simulated version of an object. In Mockito, you can create mocks using `Mockito.mock(ClassName.class)`.

2. **Stubbing**:  
   Stubbing is the process of pre-defining the behavior of a mock when a specific method is called. For example:
   ```java
   when(mockedObject.methodCall()).thenReturn(desiredValue);
   ```

3. **Spy**:  
   A spy is a partial mockâ€”it lets you mock some methods while keeping the actual behavior of others. You can create spies using `Mockito.spy(ClassName)`.

4. **Verification**:  
   Verifying ensures that a specific method on a mock was called with the expected arguments. Example:
   ```java
   verify(mockedObject).methodCall();
   ```

5. **Argument Matchers**:  
   Matchers like `any()`, `eq()`, etc., are used when defining behavior or verifying interactions. For example:
   ```java
   when(mockedObject.methodCall(anyString())).thenReturn(desiredValue);
   ```

6. **Annotations**:  
   Mockito provides annotations like `@Mock`, `@InjectMocks`, and `@Spy` to make your code cleaner. These require the use of `MockitoAnnotations.initMocks()`.

7. **InOrder**:  
   Allows you to verify that methods were called in a specific order. Example:
   ```java
   InOrder inOrder = inOrder(mock1, mock2);
   inOrder.verify(mock1).firstMethod();
   inOrder.verify(mock2).secondMethod();
   ```

8. **doAnswer / doThrow / doNothing**:  
   Used to define behavior for void methods or more advanced scenarios. For example:
   ```java
   doThrow(new RuntimeException()).when(mockedObject).voidMethod();
   ```
